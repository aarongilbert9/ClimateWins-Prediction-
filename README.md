# ClimateWins-Prediction-
### Overview
This project is part of a machine learning course focused on predicting weather variations using advanced algorithms. The aim is to help ClimateWins, an organization committed to forecasting and understanding climate change, achieve its goals. The project spans two achievements, each exploring different machine learning techniques applied to historical weather data to predict atmospheric conditions.
### Objectives
* Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
* Determine if unusual weather patterns are increasing over time.
* Generate possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years.
* Identify the safest places for people to live in Europe over the next 25 to 50 years.
### Dataset
For this project, the following datasets were used:

Weather Conditions Dataset
Downloaded from Kaggle, this dataset includes images of various weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy.

Answers Dataset for Pleasant Weather Prediction
Provided by Career Foundry, this dataset labels "pleasant" days as 1 and "unpleasant" days as 0. It was used to evaluate different machine learning models for predicting pleasant weather based on weather observations.
(This dataset is proprietary and not publicly available for download.)
### Key Results
CNN Model for Visual Classification: Achieved a validation accuracy of 75% when classifying weather conditions from images.

Random Forest Model: Improved the accuracy to 73% using hyperparameter tuning techniques like grid search.

Time-Series Analysis: Demonstrated the capability to predict weather patterns using RNN, focusing on long-term climate trends.

Thought Experiments for ClimateWins
GAN for Simulating Future Weather Scenarios: Use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create simulated weather maps, helping to visualize potential climate changes.

Transfer Learning for Rare Weather Events: Apply pre-trained models on new data to detect and analyze rare weather patterns, such as extreme heatwaves.

Ensemble Learning for Enhanced Predictions: Combine CNN, RNN, and Random Forest outputs to form an ensemble model for more accurate weather predictions.
